# Repo notes for Claude

## Running & authorizing GitHub Actions workflows (IMPORTANT)

In a self-hosted/local remote environment the `gh` CLI is typically pre-authenticated — run
`gh auth status` to confirm (and `gh auth login` if not). When available it acts as a real user
(e.g. `clarkemoyer`) with `workflow` + `repo` scopes. **Prefer `gh` for anything Actions-related.**

Do NOT rely on the MCP GitHub tools to run workflows: they run through a GitHub **App installation**
whose granted scopes do not include `actions: write`, so `actions_run_trigger`/`run_workflow`
returns `403 Resource not accessible by integration`. (MCP is fine for PRs, issues, comments,
reviews — those are within the App installation's granted permissions.)

### Claude Code on the web (sandbox) — `gh` web-flow auth does NOT work here (IMPORTANT)

When running as **Claude Code on the web**, do not waste time trying to `gh auth login` (web/device
flow) to get "full org" access — it cannot work in this sandbox, and here is the proof so a future
session doesn't rediscover it the hard way:

- All outbound HTTPS goes through the agent egress proxy. The proxy **intercepts `api.github.com`
  and injects its own auth**, ignoring whatever token `gh`/`curl` sends. A request to
  `https://api.github.com/user` with a **bogus** `Authorization` header — or **no** header at all —
  still returns `200` as `clarkemoyer`. So no token a web/device flow obtains is ever used.
- Direct repo/Actions calls via that proxy auth return
  `403 "GitHub access is not enabled for this session…"` for this org, so `gh`/`curl` cannot
  dispatch workflows or approve deployments from the sandbox either.
- The **MCP** GitHub tools are the working channel in the sandbox (scoped to this repo) — but, as
  above, MCP lacks `actions: write`, so it still **cannot dispatch workflows or approve environment
  deployments**. It _can_ create/assign issues, open PRs, push files, comment, and read Actions
  runs/logs.

Net effect in the web sandbox: you cannot _dispatch_ a `workflow_dispatch` workflow, and you cannot
_approve_ an environment gate. You **can** trigger any `issues`-event workflow (e.g. Website
Provision) by creating + assigning an issue via MCP, and a human reviewer (`clarkemoyer`) approves
any environment gates. See the next section.

### Provision a website repo + add a maintainer (primary workflow)

This is the canonical way to "establish the repo for `<domain>` and add a GitHub user as
maintainer". It runs **`15. Website - Provision`** (`.github/workflows/15-website-provision.yml`),
which on `issues: [assigned]` creates `FFC-EX-<domain>` from the FFC template, enables GitHub Pages,
adds the Technical POC as a `maintain` collaborator, and (only if the zone is controlled in FFC
Cloudflare) enforces apex + `www` GitHub Pages DNS. All privileged steps run inside Actions with
`secrets.CBM_TOKEN`, so this path needs **no** `actions: write` from the caller.

From the web sandbox (works today), using the admin-minimal template
(`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/07-adminonly-provision-website.yml`) — create the issue **with an
assignee** via MCP so the `assigned` event fires:

- Title: `[WEBSITE REQUEST] <domain>` (apex, no `https://`, no `www`)
- Labels: `website-request`, `admin-provision`, `github-pages`, `cloudflare`
- Body sections (issue-form headings are parsed verbatim):
  - `### Website Domain (no http://)` → `<domain>`
  - `### Technical POC GitHub Username` → the maintainer's GitHub login (omit/blank to skip)
- Assignee: any user (e.g. `clarkemoyer`) — assignment is what triggers the run.

> **Gotcha — keep all prose ABOVE the `###` sections.** `extractSection` captures everything from a
> heading to the next `###` _or end of body_, so any explanatory text placed **after** the last
> section (e.g. a `---` note after `### Technical POC GitHub Username`) is slurped into that field's
> value. A maintainer login then fails validation and is silently skipped
> (`Skipping invalid GitHub username for maintainer`), and the repo is created without the
> maintainer. Put any narrative at the top of the body, before `### Website Domain`.

Then watch the run via MCP (`actions_list` / `get_job_logs`). **If the zone is controlled in FFC
Cloudflare**, the `dns` (`cloudflare-prod-write`) and `repo` (`github-prod`) jobs sit at
`status: waiting` on environment approval, and `repo` is chained behind `dns` — i.e. the repo is
**only** created once the DNS repoint is approved. The sandbox cannot approve; ask `clarkemoyer` to
approve both gates (UI → _Review deployments_, or the `gh api … pending_deployments` flow below).

From a `gh`-authed environment you can instead dispatch directly:
`gh workflow run 15-website-provision.yml --ref main -f domain=<domain> -f technical_poc_github_username=<login>`.

### Dispatch a workflow

```bash
gh workflow run <workflow-file>.yml --ref <branch>
# e.g.
gh workflow run 8-whmcs-export-products.yml --ref main
```

`git push` also triggers `push`-event workflows, but environment-gated jobs still wait for approval
(see below).

### Environment approval gate (`whmcs-prod`)

Workflows that use `environment: whmcs-prod` (all WHMCS jobs) require a deployment approval; the run
sits at `status: waiting`. Reviewer is `clarkemoyer`, and `gh` is authed as them, so approve it
directly:

```bash
RUN_ID=<run id>
# find the environment id + confirm you can approve
gh api repos/FreeForCharity/FFC-Cloudflare-Automation/actions/runs/$RUN_ID/pending_deployments \
  --jq '.[] | {env: .environment.name, env_id: .environment.id, current_user_can_approve}'
# approve
gh api -X POST repos/FreeForCharity/FFC-Cloudflare-Automation/actions/runs/$RUN_ID/pending_deployments \
  -F "environment_ids[]=<env_id>" -f state=approved -f comment="approved"
```

(Note: the approval API returns an array of deployment objects; don't apply a `--jq` filter that
assumes a single object.)

### Watch a run / read results

```bash
gh run view <run id>                 # summary
gh run view <run id> --log           # full logs (read-only export catalogs print here)
gh api repos/FreeForCharity/FFC-Cloudflare-Automation/actions/runs/<id>/jobs --jq '.jobs[]|{name,status,conclusion}'
```

To wait for completion, poll in a background Bash task with an `until`/loop on
`gh api .../runs/<id> --jq '.status'` (do not foreground-sleep).

## WHMCS API

- Endpoint: `https://freeforcharity.org/hub/includes/api.php`. Identifier is inline in workflows;
  the secret value is stored under the GitHub Actions **secret named**
  `ZBBEPFQ5W7RCSIME0NOQOYRQIDGTKBPU` (this is the secret name/key, not the value), referenced as
  `${{ secrets.ZBBEPFQ5W7RCSIME0NOQOYRQIDGTKBPU }}`, plus the secret named `WHMCS_API_ACCESS_KEY`.
  These secrets live only in the `whmcs-prod` environment, so WHMCS scripts can't run from this
  sandbox directly — run them via Actions.
- Onboarding scripts: `whmcs-client-add.ps1` (AddClient), `whmcs-contact-add.ps1` (AddContact),
  `whmcs-order-add.ps1` (AddOrder), shared helpers in `whmcs-api-common.ps1`. Product/custom-field
  discovery via `whmcs-products-export.ps1` (prints a catalog to the job log).
