# GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository uses GitHub Actions workflows to ensure code quality, security, and support DNS
management operations.

## ci.yml - Continuous Integration

Runs automated validation and security checks on all pull requests and pushes to main branch.

### When it runs:

- On pull requests targeting `main` branch
- On pushes to `main` branch

### What it does:

**Validate Repository Job:**

1. Checks out the code
2. Lints GitHub Actions workflows (actionlint)
3. Checks formatting for supported files (Prettier)
4. Validates PowerShell scripts for syntax errors (PowerShell parser)
5. Lints PowerShell scripts (PSScriptAnalyzer)
6. Checks PowerShell formatting (Invoke-Formatter)
7. Scans for accidentally committed sensitive files (_.pem, _.key, .env)
8. Verifies README.md exists

This workflow ensures that:

- GitHub Actions workflow YAML is well-formed and consistent (actionlint)
- Common file formats (YAML/Markdown/JSON/CSS/HTML) stay consistently formatted (Prettier)
- PowerShell scripts are syntactically correct (parser)
- PowerShell code quality rules are enforced (PSScriptAnalyzer; CI fails on errors)
- PowerShell formatting is consistent (Invoke-Formatter; CI fails if formatting differs)
- No sensitive data is accidentally committed
- Documentation exists

### Local usage

- Prettier (check): `npx --yes prettier@3.3.3 --check . --ignore-unknown`
- Prettier (write): `npx --yes prettier@3.3.3 --write . --ignore-unknown`
- actionlint (requires Go):
  - Install: `go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest`
  - Run: `actionlint`
- PowerShell formatting (repo helper): run
  [scripts/format-powershell.ps1](../../scripts/format-powershell.ps1)
- PowerShell lint summary (repo helper): run
  [scripts/analyze-powershell.ps1](../../scripts/analyze-powershell.ps1)

Notes:

- Prettier configuration lives in [.prettierrc.json](../../.prettierrc.json) and
  [.prettierignore](../../.prettierignore).
- Prettier does not format PowerShell; PowerShell formatting is handled by Invoke-Formatter.

## codeql-analysis.yml - Security Scanning

Performs automated security analysis using GitHub's CodeQL engine to detect security issues in
GitHub Actions workflows.

### When it runs:

- On pull requests targeting `main` branch
- On pushes to `main` branch
- Scheduled: Every Monday at 6:00 AM UTC

### What it does:

1. Checks out the code
2. Initializes CodeQL for GitHub Actions workflow analysis
3. Performs security analysis
4. Uploads results to GitHub Security tab

### Required Permissions:

- `actions: read` - Read workflow information
- `contents: read` - Read repository contents
- `security-events: write` - Upload security scan results

This workflow helps identify security vulnerabilities early in the development process, including:

- Workflow injection risks (untrusted inputs used in shell commands)
- Dangerous trigger patterns (e.g., unsafe use of privileged contexts)
- Excessive permissions or missing least-privilege settings

## Current Workflow

This repository uses an **issue-based workflow** for domain management:

1. **Users** submit requests using GitHub issue templates
2. **Administrators** review requests and execute DNS changes using:
   - PowerShell scripts in this repo
   - Cloudflare API
   - GitHub Actions workflows for exports and automation
3. **Changes are tracked** via GitHub issues for full audit trail

## Required Setup

No additional setup is required for these workflows to run. However, to get the most value:

1. **Enable CodeQL scanning in repository settings:**

   - Go to Settings > Security > Code scanning
   - CodeQL results will appear in the Security tab

2. **Review workflow results:**

   - Check the Actions tab for workflow runs
   - Address any failures before merging PRs

3. **Configure branch protection:**
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require up-to-date branches before merging

## Best Practices

- Never commit sensitive data like API keys, passwords, or private keys
- Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets for sensitive values
- Review the `.gitignore` file to ensure sensitive files are excluded
- Address security alerts from CodeQL promptly
- Use issue templates for all domain management requests
- Document DNS changes in the corresponding GitHub issue
- Test DNS changes with dry-run mode before applying
