name: '96. Deprecated - Cloudflare DNS Run (legacy)'

# NOTE:
# This workflow previously contained the older "cloudflare-dns-run" automation.
# The repository has since been refactored to the numbered PowerShell workflows
# and the simplified 01/02 domain workflows.
#
# Keeping this stub prevents stale links and makes it clear what to use instead.
