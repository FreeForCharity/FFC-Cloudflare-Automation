        Assignment triggers automation.

        Please read carefully before filling this out:
        - Do not enter `N/A` in any field.
        - We use automation + volunteers. Support is **best effort**.

        - **Address**: Displayed in the footer and used for map links. Must be a real US mailing address.
        - **Links**: Footer social links must use **https://**.
